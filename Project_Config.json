            "description": "Developed and deployed an interactive Streamlit web application that enables users to estimate optimal interior lighting setups for various room types. The tool uses user-inputted room dimensions, window properties, and color data to calculate area, volume, natural light factor, average reflectance, and required lumens using custom utilities and domain best practices. Visualization is handled by a dynamic, interactive 3D Plotly rendering of the room with fixture recommendations and light distribution cones. The platform computes efficient luminaire types with detailed cost and energy analysis, and also lets users export PDF reports. Features include intuitive sidebar navigation, advanced Plotly 3D visualization, customized lighting calculations, and automated PDF report generation for professional results.",
